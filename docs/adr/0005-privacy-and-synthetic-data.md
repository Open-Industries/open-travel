# ADR-0005: Privacy by design; all reference data is synthetic

## Context

A public reference core must be safe to clone, demo and audit. ISO 27002 A.5.34.

## Decision

Booking references (PNR) are validated at creation and never stored or returned in clear — only a masked form is kept. Traveler personal and document data is never stored by this core; all data is synthetic. Card data stays with certified PSPs. Internal keys are UUIDs and no real personal or confidential data ever enters this repository.

## Consequences

Correlation with production records happens through the adopter's governed processes, not this API.
